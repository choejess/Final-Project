				<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
				<br />
				<p>
					The data revealed the states with highest crime rates are Missouri, Georgia, Michigan and New Jersey.
					These states were all located at middle and eastern United States.
					States located on the western side of the United States showed lower crime rates compared to states in
					eastern United States. When looking at the actual numbers, Texas, California and New York had the highest total crime.
					But when looking at the crime rates, Utah and Minnesota had the highest rates.
					This is because of the difference in population. Even though one states might have the highest number of crimes,
					the ranking can differ when looking at the percentage.
					The crime rates seem to decrease as the economic factors increase (such as unemployment rate and average income).
