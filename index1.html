					Crime is an action or omission that constitutes an offense that may be prosecuted by the state and is punishable by law.			
					Crime rates continues to decrease as times passes, however the number of crimes committed in USA is still very high.
					It is directly linked with the safety of the people. In order to ensure the safety, it is important to understand the
					trend that crime rate have and invest to decrease the overall crime rate.

					In this final project, I will analyze the crimes rates within different states in U.S. The crime rate
					will be analyzed by looking into different factors such as different states, what kind of crime was committed,
					and the socioeconomic status. By studying and analyzing this information, we can understand more deeply about
					how these factors might influence the crime rate.
